## Features
 - Based on a Distributed Hash Table architecture.
 -- There is no central server, every device makes a piece of the network.
 - Community oriented
 -- The DHT is split into clusters called communities, which users can join at the approval of the community majority. This speeds up the network, as well as manages the resource load needed per device.
 -- Members of communities share common resources and scripts.
 -- Scripts can be used to customise the behaviour of individual clients in relation to each other, resulting in complex interactions within the Community.
 - Multi-platform
 -- Currently the network is being developed to be fully functional on standalone as well as Android devices, but with its modular design, it should be easy to port it to other platforms.
